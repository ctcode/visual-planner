This information is then displayed in your browser in a year-view format that provides a much wider and more flexible overview of your future and past events than is available with Google Calendar.

The app **DOES NOT** transfer, store or share any of this data or any other personal information.

The app **DOES** store it's own settings data in your Google Drive.

The app **DOES** use Google Analytics to monitor application usage statistics and server error messages.
